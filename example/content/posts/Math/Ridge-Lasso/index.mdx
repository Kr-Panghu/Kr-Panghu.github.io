## Introduction

In Machine learning, Ridge and Lasso are two common regularization methods.

The equation of Ridge and Lasso are as follows:

Ridge: $L_{ridge} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \beta_0 - \sum_{j=1}^{p} \beta_j x_{ij})^2 + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^{p} \beta_j^2$

Lasso: $L_{lasso} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \beta_0 - \sum_{j=1}^{p} \beta_j x_{ij})^2 + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^{p} |\beta_j|$

We know that Ridge will penalize those dimensions with large $\beta$, which results in a dense solution. Lasso will penalize those dimensions with small $\beta$, which results in a sparse solution.

However, what if we combine Ridge and Lasso together? That is, we use the following equation:

$$
\mathcal{L}=\|Y-X \beta\|_2^2+\lambda_2\|\beta\|^2+\lambda_1\|\beta\|_1
$$

Then what will happen to the $\beta$? Will it be sparse or dense?

## Elastic Net Regularization

Actually, the combined regularization is called Elastic Net Regularization. It is a linear combination of L1 and L2 regularization. It combines the advantages of Ridge and Lasso regularization.

**Advantages:**

- Elastic Net combines the strengths of both Lasso and Ridge. It can select features among a large number of redundant features and also handle highly correlated features.
- When there is multicollinearity among features, Elastic Net can select a group of correlated features to participate together in model building, enhancing model stability.

**Disadvantages:**

- Parameter tuning, such as the regularization strength α and the L1/L2 weights ρ, needs to be carefully selected through methods like cross-validation; otherwise, it might lead to poor model performance.
- Compared to Lasso alone, Elastic Net's solutions may not be sparse enough in extremely sparse problems, which could reduce model interpretability.
